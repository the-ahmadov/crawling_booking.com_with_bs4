# crawling_booking.com_with_bs4
The project crawls data about hotels and reviews in given country (based on URL) saving it in excel file.

The project consists of 2 files: main.py and functions.py where the core is gathered in second file.
To start the program just run the main.py, but make sure that both files in the same directories.
Otherwise, 'import functions' line in the main.py will throw an exception as it can't find the functions.py

The logic of main.py is quite simple though.
